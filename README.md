# Personal Portfolio

In the project directory, you can run:

## Description

This portfolio was initally made during my Rutger Bootcamp Course. Once the course ended I took the time to start a new repository and update my portfolio with the latest projects and styles I wanted on it at the time. There will be constant updates throughout my career as a developer.

This portfolio was made using Tailwind and REACT.

This site was deployed on Netlify.
