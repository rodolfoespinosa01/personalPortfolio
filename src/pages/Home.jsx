        <p className="text-[#006494] py-4 max-w-[700px]">I'm a dedicated full-stack developer with a passion for crafting innovative solutions. Currently, I am actively seeking full-time opportunities to contribute my skills and expertise to a dynamic team. As I actively pursue job opportunities, I am earnestly dedicating my efforts to the development of my personal projectâ€”an advanced diet generator. This endeavor reflects my commitment to making a positive impact on global nutrition and well-being.

          My goal is to seamlessly integrate the cutting-edge diet algorithm I've developed into my web application. By doing so, I aim to empower millions of individuals worldwide to enhance their overall nutrition lifestyle. I believe in the power of technology to transform lives, and I am excited about the prospect of joining a forward-thinking company where I can contribute my knowledge while continuing to build and innovate on the side.

          If you are a recruiter or employer interested in a full-stack developer passionate about health tech and dedicated to ongoing personal projects, I would love to connect with you.
